## General info
This python package allows to any python application to simply sent running information to a phone app.

It is born from the basic need to remotely knowing the status of a test run during automatic test campaign. 
As an embedded developer on a maker project I discover the Blynk.io easy to use phone application and decided 
to give it a try in order to make my application talking to me.
